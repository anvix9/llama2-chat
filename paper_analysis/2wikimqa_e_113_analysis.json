Some sources suggest she was born in 1684, while others claim 1687 or 1690. Her father was said to be a Polish farmer named Samuel Skowro\u0144ski, while some accounts identify her mother as a Lithuanian woman named Elizabeth Moritz. Catherine I's early life is largely undocumented, with few records available from the time period.\n\nQ2: Catherine I became empress regnant of Russia after the death of her husband, Peter the Great, in 1725. Peter had no male heirs, and Catherine was chosen as his successor due to her close relationship with him and her influence over the Russian court. Catherine was crowned empress on February 9, 1724, and ruled until her death in 1727.\n\nQ3: As ruler of Russia, Catherine I implemented policies aimed at reducing military spending and taxing the peasantry to alleviate economic burdens. She also focused on building infrastructure, including bridges and palaces, and encouraged the development of trade and commerce. Catherine was known for her fairness and justice, earning her a reputation as a popular ruler among the Russian people.\n\nQ4: Catherine I died on May 17, 1727, at the age of 43. The cause of her death is uncertain, with some sources citing tuberculosis or an abscess in her lungs, while others suggest she may have died from a stroke or other illness.\n\nQ5: Catherine I's reign had significant implications for Russian history. She was the first woman to rule Imperial Russia, paving the way for future female rulers such as her daughter Elizabeth and granddaughter-in-law Catherine the Great. Catherine's policies focused on modernizing Russia's military, economy, and infrastructure, laying the groundwork for the country's future growth and influence. Her reign also marked a shift in the balance of power within the Russian government, with the Supreme Privy Council concentrating authority in the hands of one party. Overall, Catherine I's reign had a profound impact on Russian history, shaping the country's political, social, and economic landscape for generations to come.",
